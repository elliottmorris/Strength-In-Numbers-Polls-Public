<h2>Questions</h2>
<ul class='toc'>
<li><a href="#q1">Generally speaking, do you think the United States today is on the right track, or is it headed in the wrong direction?</a></li>
<li><a href="#q2">Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president?</a></li>
<li><a href="#q3">In your opinion, what is the most important problem facing the country today? - Selected Choice</a></li>
<li><a href="#q4">Which political party do you think will do a better job handling [QID125-ChoiceGroup-SelectedChoices]?</a></li>
<li><a href="#q5">Now thinking about the parties' positions on all these issues, which issue do you think the Democratic Party generally cares most about? - Selected Choice</a></li>
<li><a href="#q6">Which issue do you think the Republican Party generally cares most about? - Selected Choice</a></li>
<li><a href="#q7">When it comes to Donald Trump's presidency and politics news more broadly, what topic have you heard the most about over the last month? - Selected Choice</a></li>
<li><a href="#q8">Thinking about how the economy is doing in the country as a whole, do you think that conditions are better now or worse than they were a year ago?</a></li>
<li><a href="#q9">And thinking about your own personal finances, how would you say you and your family are doing compared to this point a year ago?</a></li>
<li><a href="#q10">We would like to know how you and your family are handling prices of household items such as groceries and gas. How have prices changed in your personal family budget over the last year?</a></li>
<li><a href="#q11">President Trump campaigned on a promise to deport all immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally back to their home countries. Do you support or oppose deporting all undocumented immigrants, regardless of whether they have committed other crimes or how long they have been in the U.S.?</a></li>
<li><a href="#q12">The U.S. recently removed an undocumented immigrant named Kilmar Abrego Garcia living in Maryland to a prison in El Salvador, despite a judge ruling that he should not be sent to El Salvador due to a credible fear he would be killed by a violent gang if he returned to the country. The U.S. has said the deportation was a mistake. Do you support or oppose the U.S. deporting people with similar protections as Kilmar Abrego Garcia, even if it means the government is violating court orders?</a></li>
<li><a href="#q13">A U.S. judge recently ruled that the U.S. wrongly removed several other undocumented immigrants to a prison in El Salvador, and ordered the government to facilitate their return home. President Trump has so far refused to ask the President of El Salvador to hand the deportees back over to U.S. custody to be returned home. Do you think Trump is right to keep the men in El Salvador, or should he return them home?</a></li>
<li><a href="#q14">President Trump has recently revoked the visas of several international students who were in the U.S. legally because of comments they made about Israel and Palestine, which the government claims presents significant risks to U.S. foreign policy. Do you think the president of the United States should have the power to detain and deport foreign nationals who are here legally on student visas, who have not committed a crime?</a></li>
<li><a href="#q15">President Trump has recently suggested the U.S. should send citizens who have committed violent crimes to foreign prisons, such as the one in El Salvador that was built to hold violent gang members for indefinite imprisonment. Legal scholars have said the president does not have the power to deport citizens from the country. Do you think the U.S. should deport violent citizens to foreign prisons?</a></li>
<li><a href="#q16">The United States must pass a budget every year to fund the military, provide social services such as public schools, Medicaid and welfare, and keep government offices open. Republicans in Congress have proposed a budget that would make Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts on corporations and middle-class families permanent, and increase military spending, but require the U.S. to cut hundreds of billions of dollars in spending on social programs. If the U.S. extends tax cuts but does not decrease spending, the budget deficit will continue to grow. Thinking about the options Congress has, would you rather see it…</a></li>
<li><a href="#q17">The government also spends money on aid programs for foreign countries. For example, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2024, the federal government spent $6.5 billion on HIV treatment for tens of millions of people in foreign countries, as well as $406 million preventing deaths from Tuberculosis, a curable bacterial infection that kills over 1 million people globally each year. Do you think the U.S. should keep spending money on programs like these, even if that means the government would have to raise taxes or run a budget deficit?</a></li>
<li><a href="#q18">Officials at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) last month estimated that budget cuts to their agency from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a government initiative to cut federal spending led by Elon Musk, could decrease the amount of taxes the U.S. government collects by roughly $500 billion dollars this tax year. DOGE claims it has canceled roughly $160 billion in spending including things such as technology contracts, office rentals, education spending, and staffing at government agencies. DOGE has also had to spend money hiring back government employees it mistakenly terminated. Do you personally think the cuts to government spending from DOGE have been worth it?</a></li>

<h3>The U.S. recently removed an undocumented immigrant named Kilmar Abrego Garcia living in Maryland to a prison in El Salvador, despite a judge ruling that he should not be sent to El Salvador due to a credible fear he would be killed by a violent gang if he returned to the country. The U.S. has said the deportation was a mistake. Do you support or oppose the U.S. deporting people with similar protections as Kilmar Abrego Garcia, even if it means the government is violating court orders?</h3>

<h3>A U.S. judge recently ruled that the U.S. wrongly removed several other undocumented immigrants to a prison in El Salvador, and ordered the government to facilitate their return home. President Trump has so far refused to ask the President of El Salvador to hand the deportees back over to U.S. custody to be returned home. Do you think Trump is right to keep the men in El Salvador, or should he return them home?</h3>

<h3>The United States must pass a budget every year to fund the military, provide social services such as public schools, Medicaid and welfare, and keep government offices open. Republicans in Congress have proposed a budget that would make Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts on corporations and middle-class families permanent, and increase military spending, but require the U.S. to cut hundreds of billions of dollars in spending on social programs. If the U.S. extends tax cuts but does not decrease spending, the budget deficit will continue to grow. Thinking about the options Congress has, would you rather see it…</h3>

<h3>The government also spends money on aid programs for foreign countries. For example, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2024, the federal government spent $6.5 billion on HIV treatment for tens of millions of people in foreign countries, as well as $406 million preventing deaths from Tuberculosis, a curable bacterial infection that kills over 1 million people globally each year. Do you think the U.S. should keep spending money on programs like these, even if that means the government would have to raise taxes or run a budget deficit?</h3>

<h3>Officials at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) last month estimated that budget cuts to their agency from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a government initiative to cut federal spending led by Elon Musk, could decrease the amount of taxes the U.S. government collects by roughly $500 billion dollars this tax year. DOGE claims it has canceled roughly $160 billion in spending including things such as technology contracts, office rentals, education spending, and staffing at government agencies. DOGE has also had to spend money hiring back government employees it mistakenly terminated. Do you personally think the cuts to government spending from DOGE have been worth it?</h3>
